# Short Summary about the project:
This is a VR-Based project that focuses on proposing a virtual reality solution that includes exposure therapy, guided meditation, and VR expedition. The controlled environment virtual solutions are designed to help individuals overcome their fears and phobias by gradually exposing them to different levels of difficulty in a safe and controlled virtual environment. 
# Where is the code sample?
The code samples that I wanted to show are located in Sattva_VR > Assets > Scripts

They are some c# scripts that are attached to different components in the scenes to perform different tasks.
